# Real-Time-DDoS-Detection-in-Software-Defined-Networks-
• Developed and evaluated machine learning models (Random Forest, KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Naive
  Bayes) for DDoS detection.
• Implemented Real-time network simulation in an SDN environment.
• Utilized advanced data preprocessing techniques (feature selection, data balancing, scaling).
• Simulated and detected real-time DDoS attacks.
• Contributed to cybersecurity with a combined approach of machine learning and SDN simulation.
